    Here is some Bob Ross Lorem Ipsum. Enjoy!

        "Isn't that fantastic? La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.

        Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Use your imagination, let it go.
        </p>

        Let's have a nice tree right here. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here.

        And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them.

        I thought today we would do a happy little picture. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.

        Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. It is a lot of fun. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.
        </p>
        <p>
        I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.""
